Ms. Heard: "He was also sober for a period in 2012, which was a peaceful time for us in which we fell in love. So, I had kind of allowed myself, I guess, to forget the beginning of that period, before he got sober, was really violent and chaotic as well. I am embarrassed to say that."
Ms. Bredehoft: "Okay. I'm going to take you to the tape recordings. Why did you and Mr. Depp start taping each other?"
Ms. Heard: "Well, at first, it was...not at first, it was meant to be a way to get to the heart of some of our communication issues, and in order to do...to discover in a therapeutic fashion kind of what was some of our issues in our communication were."
Ms. Bredehoft: "So, what did Mr. Depp say in your discussions about the use of the term threatening to divorce or threatening to leave each other?"
Ms. Heard: "Well, Johnny would always say, 'The only way out of this was death.' But in fights, in particularly heated ones, we had found...you know, we were using divorce in the fight, in some of our heated fights. We tried not to, but that kind of deteriorated after the December incident that I got beat up pretty badly. And after that point, it was used a lot more often"
Ms. Bredehoft: "Okay. Now, March 26, 2015, this is after the first Australia trip and after the staircase incident. I'm going to ask, Michelle, can you bring up Depp Exhibit 371A?"
Judge Azcarate: "Plaintiff's 371A then. Any objection?"
Ms. Vasquez: "No objection."
Judge Azcarate: "Okay, 371A in evidence. Thank you."
Ms. Heard [Audio Recording]: "I see somebody who's changing into different versions of a person that I recognize for a brief moment, and then he slips away, then he disappears. Then I get different versions of him. I get the insecure or scared version of him that lashes out in a different medium every time."
Ms. Heard [Audio Recording]: "So if it's Adderall or Junkie Johnny, then he's abusive and he's a tyrant and he's mean, he's reactionary and he's [inaudible], and anything I do and say is cause for violence or anger."
Ms. Heard [Audio Recording]: "If I speak bluntly from the heart, I'm yelling at him. If I argue back with him, then I'm abusive. If I don't say anything, then I'm dismissive or absent or somewhere else. If I engage with him, I'm part of the problem, I'm the one that was mean. If I don't engage with him, then I'm part of the problem. No matter what I do I'm fucked."
Ms. Heard [Audio Recording]: "Because if I look at him in the wrong way, it's a problem. If I say the wrong thing no matter what it is, I'm the problem. I'm the problem no matter what. That's the guy who's on a bunch of fucking speed."
Ms. Bredehoft: "What did you mean when you were saying that to Mr."
Depp?
Ms. Heard: "That no matter my perception was, no matter what I did, no matter what I did to de-escalate, walk away from him, to confront him, to try to...nothing I did made a difference, nothing I did change his rage at me, nothing I did change the violence towards me, nothing I did calm him down, and I was constantly doing a juggling act of what kind of version of Johnny I was dealing with."
Ms. Heard: "There were different versions of him and they were drastically different from one another, and even more so than them being different from one another, they didn't even sometimes remember what the other version did or said."
Ms. Heard: "They acted almost like independent versions of his person, depending on what combination of drugs and alcohol he was on. That's what I was trying to express to him. It's just the futility of me responding successfully and the futility of trying to constantly negotiate with him and the substances he was on at the time."

#"May 18, 2022, Continued."

Judge Azcarate: "Thank you. All right, be seated. Cross-examination."
Ms. Vasquez: "Good afternoon, Ms. Heard."
Ms. Vasquez: "Mr. Depp hasn't looked at you once this entire trial, has he?"
Ms. Heard: "Not that I've noticed, no."
Ms. Vasquez: "You've looked at him, though, many times, haven't you?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, I have."
Ms. Vasquez: "You know exactly why Mr. Depp won't look back at you, don't you?"
Ms. Heard: "I do."
Ms. Vasquez: "He promised you he would never...you would never see his eyes again. Isn't that true?"
Ms. Heard: "I don't recall if he said that."
Ms. Vasquez: "One of the last times you ever saw Mr. Depp was when you met him in San Francisco in July of 2016, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That was the second to last time I saw him, yes"
Ms. Vasquez: "And this was after you had publicly accused him of domestic violence?"
Ms. Heard: "I got my restraining order before that, yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's please play Plaintiff's Exhibit 1229. For the record, it's at 11:01 through 12:09. I'm going to ask that it be admitted into evidence."
Judge Azcarate: "Any objection to 1229?"
Ms. Bredehoft: "No objection."
Judge Azcarate: "Okay, 1229 entered in its entirety. Go ahead and play your section."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Is this how you want it to end? I don't understand, is this what you want?"
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No. Oh no, a hug will save it all. All this, everything you just did to me."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Please, babe. I don't know. I just wanted to touch you. Seriously, it's..."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "Really, after all the shit you just said?"
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Yes, I just wanted to give you a hug, I just.."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "After all the shit you fucking accused me of, you wanna touch me?"
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Yes, yes, please, please hug me"
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "You're fucking nuts"
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Please, I just wanted to hug you and say bye. I didn't want it to end bad."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "Oh, there is no chance of that. We did that last night, it was fine. That was good enough."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "I don't know what else to say."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No, 'cause I'm nothing to you, and I will always be nothing to you."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Please, please, calm. Calm down, baby, please."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "What? You're not my shrink."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Please. Please, put your hand on my heart. Please just feel my heart, please."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "Please, I need to know if we'll ever see each other again, please."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No, we'll never see each other again. We will never...don't take my fucking glasses off. You don't like fucking looking at not my fucking eyes? You will not see my eyes again"
Ms. Vasquez: "This is from when you and Mr. Depp met in San Francisco in July of 2016, right? After you had publicly accused him of domestic abuse?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, and got my TRO."
Ms. Vasquez: "And he tells you, 'You will not see my eyes again.' And he has kept that promise, hasn't he?"
Ms. Heard: "As far as I know, he cannot look at me"
Ms. Vasquez: "He won't look at you, right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "He can't."
Ms. Vasquez: "(Internal Thoughts). What next?  [Evidence] Listen to the recording where Ms. Heard ridicules the notion of Mr. Depp announcing to the public that he has been a victim of domestic violence or [Evidence] Show the court the text messages where Mr. Depp discusses his travel plans during the time of the alleged incidents."
Mr. Chew: "Remember, we need to focus on the core of our argument. The text messages about travel plans, while interesting, don't directly challenge the narrative we're contesting. It's more impactful to use the recording where Ms. Heard mocks Mr. Depp's claim of being a victim. This directly addresses the credibility of her statements and supports our case more effectively."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's please play Plaintiff's Exhibit 357A, which is already in evidence, Your Honor. And for the record, it's 21:22 through 21:40."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "And see what the jury and judge thinks. Tell the world, Johnny. Tell them, Johnny Depp, 'I, Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of female domestic violence and, you know, it's a fair fight,' and see how many people believe or side with you."
Ms. Vasquez: "That's your voice on that recording, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, it is."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you said to Mr. Depp, 'You can please tell people that it was a fair fight and see what the jury and the judge think. Tell the world, Johnny, tell them, 'Johnny Depp, I, Johnny Depp, a man, a victim too of domestic violence.' That's what you said, right?"
Ms. Heard: "I was saying it to the man who beat me up, yes. I thought it was preposterous."
Ms. Vasquez: "And the man you beat up numerous times, right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I could never hurt Johnny."
Ms. Vasquez: "You didn't think he would tell the world he was a victim of domestic violence, did you?"
Ms. Heard: "I found it hard to believe that he could or that he would do that considering the relationship he and I had. I thought it would be crazy for him to do so knowing what I know we lived through."
Ms. Vasquez: "Or, as you said to him in that recording, who was going to believe that Johnny Depp, a man, is a victim of domestic violence, right?"
Ms. Heard: "With all due respect, I wasn't saying it because he's a man, I was saying it because he was a man who beat me up for five years."
Ms. Vasquez: "Keep pushing or Back off?"
Mr. Chew: "We’ve got her feet to the fire! We have to take advantage of this opportunity."
Ms. Vasquez: "Mr. Depp is your victim, isn't he?"
Ms. Heard: "No, ma'am."
Ms. Vasquez: "And once he left you, you continue to abuse him publicly by calling him an abuser, didn't you?"
Ms. Heard: "He is an abuser and you can look either of us up online and figure out who's being abused."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's look at some of that. Mr. Depp wears rings on every finger, doesn't he, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "That's my experience, yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "Every one of his fingers is adorned, your words, 'Big, chunky rings.' Isn't that right?"
Ms. Heard: "That's my experience of him."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you've never known him not to wear these rings?"
Ms. Heard: "That's my experience is he normally wore rings, yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "So, Mr. Depp was wearing these big chunky rings on every finger in every incident of abuse you've described to this jury, right?"
Ms. Vasquez: "Ms. Heard, you testified to an incident in March of 2013 where Mr. Depp hit you in the face multiple times. And you testified, 'You don't know how many times he hit you in the face.'"
Ms. Heard: "I can't say for certain it was in every single incident, though in general, my experience with Mr. Depp is that he wears rings almost all the time."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you testified, 'You don't know how many times he hit you in the face.' So, Mr. Depp hit you in the face multiple times while he was wearing rings on this occasion, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Which occasion in March are you referencing?"
Ms. Vasquez: "The testimony that you gave on day 15 of this trial, March of 2013, you weren't specific as to the day."
Ms. Heard: "There were several incidents."
Ms. Vasquez: "The one where he hit you several times in the face. March of 2013."
Ms. Heard: "Right. What are you asking me? I'm sorry."
Ms. Vasquez: "He was wearing rings on that occasion?"
Ms. Heard: "I pretty much always knew him to wear rings."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay, let's please pull up Defendant's Exhibit 170A, which is already in evidence, Your Honor."
Ms. Vasquez: "You testified this is a picture you took after that incident, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, that was one where he grabbed me."
Ms. Vasquez: "And hit you in the face so many times that you don't remember. And there's no injuries to your face in this picture, are there?"
Ms. Heard: "Not that this picture shows."
Ms. Vasquez: "And there's no medical records reflecting that you sought treatment after this alleged incident either."
Ms. Heard: "I did not need to go to the doctor at the time."
Ms. Vasquez: "Despite hitting you several times that you lost count with rings on his fingers?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct, I did not seek medical attention, other than my therapist."
Ms. Vasquez: "You testified to another incident in March of 2013 where Mr. Depp hit you while he was wearing a lot of rings, and you testified you felt like your lip went through your teeth and it got a little blood on the wall?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, I remember that."
Ms. Vasquez: "You didn't produce any photographs after that alleged incident, did you, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Vasquez: "You didn't show any pictures to this jury after describing that alleged incident that your teeth...your lip went into your teeth. You don't remember that, right? You didn't show any pictures to this jury after describing that incident, right?"
Ms. Heard: "I don't believe I've seen that picture admitted."
Ms. Vasquez: "That picture doesn't exist. The only picture that you've produced and shown to this jury is the one that was just put up on the screen, where you said he hit you multiple times in the face and you appear to have what is a bruise on your arm."
Ms. Vasquez: "You testified about an incident in Russia on or about June 26th, 2013. Do you remember that?"
Ms. Heard: "I do."
Ms. Vasquez: "You testified that Mr. Depp, 'whacked you in the face.'"
Ms. Heard: "I did."
Ms. Vasquez: "And then according to your testimony, when you came out of the bathroom, Jerry Judge, Mr. Depp's security guard who has passed away, pointed out that your nose was bleeding. And you said you hadn't known that your nose is bleeding until Jerry Judge pointed it out to you?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, that's correct. I was unaware until he brought it up to me. I didn't see it when I was in the bathroom but I wasn't looking."
Ms. Vasquez: "So, it's your testimony that you went into the bathroom and didn't look in the mirror, which I assume was in the bathroom, to notice that your nose is bleeding?"
Ms. Heard: "That's not why I went into the bathroom. I went into the bathroom crying, I don't even know if I paid attention to the mirror. I certainly didn't enough to notice any blood."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you didn't take any pictures of your bloody nose either, but pictures were taken of you in Russia, though. Isn't that correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, that's correct. We had a press...or a dinner."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's please pull up Plaintiff's Exhibit 1248."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's please pull up Plaintiff's Exhibit 1248. Ms. Heard, this is a picture of you in Russia after the incident, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you have no visible injuries to your face, do you?"
Ms. Heard: "None that you can see."
Ms. Vasquez: "Even though Mr. Depp whacked you in the face so hard that your nose bled, while wearing chunky big rings, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You also testify that Mr. Depp, again, whacked you in the face after the Met Gala in May of 2014. You testify that you thought he hit you so hard he broke your nose."
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You said your nose was, 'Swollen, discolored, red.' You testified you took a picture of your face after this, but you didn't show that picture to the jury, did you?"
Ms. Vasquez: "You understand you're under an obligation to produce all photographs after any alleged incidents of violence, right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I produced everything."
Ms. Vasquez: "You also understand that you're under an obligation to produce all medical records reflecting any injuries you allegedly sustained from Mr. Depp, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you haven't produced any pictures or any medical records reflecting a broken nose after the Met Gala in May of 2014, have you?"
Ms. Heard: "I have given everything to my lawyers, everything, I've turned over literally everything that I have."
Ms. Vasquez: "You also attended an event a day after the Met Gala in May of 2014. And there were pictures taken of you at this event, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's pull please pull up Plaintiff's Exhibit 1252."
Ms. Vasquez: "This is a picture of you, Ms. Heard? At that event? The night after the Met Gala? The night after Mr. Depp allegedly broke your nose?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, it is. I'm not sure if it was broken for the record, but you should see what it looked like underneath the makeup."
Ms. Vasquez: "I think this...if Your Honor is fine, this is a good stopping point."
Judge Azcarate: "Okay, that's fine. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll stop here for the evening. Remember, tonight, do not do any outside research, do not discuss the case with anybody. I know these days are a little longer and I appreciate your patience and you're taking care of everything here. Please take care of yourself tonight, okay? And we'll see you in the morning at 9AM"

#Day 18 Trial: "Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard"
# May 17, 2022
#Fairfax County, Virginia

Judge Azcarate: "Please be seated."
Judge Azcarate: "Please be seated. Ms. Vasquez, next question."
Ms. Vasquez: "Thank you, Your Honor, and good morning, Ms. Heard."
Ms. Heard: "Good morning."
Ms. Vasquez: "Your relationship with Mr. Depp began in October of 2011, and you have testified multiple times under oath that your first year with Mr. Depp was “the best of times,” correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes, that is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You also testified that Mr. Depp, as far as you could tell, was sober that first year. You called that time in your life “magical.”"
Ms. Heard: "That is what I used to believe."
Ms. Vasquez: "But now, you’ve told this jury that Mr. Depp was being violent with you throughout 2012, the very same time period, haven’t you, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "No. He was hitting me in 2012, but he took a break in the middle of the year when he was sober."
Ms. Vasquez: "You told them that he was hitting you in 2012 though. Is that right?"
Ms. Heard: "He was hitting me in 2012. He just took a break in the middle."
Ms. Vasquez: "Contradicting what you said previously, you now claim that Mr. Depp was in and out of sobriety during this time, and that “cycles of violence” followed from Mr. Depp’s alcohol consumption…"
Ms. Vasquez: "(Internal Thoughts). I have demonstrated to the jury some inconsistencies in her testimony. How should I emphasize these contradictions and most effectively cap this line of argument off?  [Evidence] Knife gifted to Mr. Depp from Ms. Heard that year or [Evidence] 2012 Photo of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard smiling together."
Mr. Chew: "I don’t know if that photo will prove anything, Ms. Vasquez. Show the jury the knife!"
Ms. Vasquez: "So, it was during these “cycles of violence” that you decided to gift Mr. Depp a knife? Master Deputy Sheriff Palusa, please show the jury."
Ms. Vasquez: "This is the knife that you gave the man that you claim would get drunk and violent with you, is that right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "…"
Ms. Heard: "At the time, I did not believe that he was going to stab me with it, that is for sure."
Ms. Vasquez: "But you gave it to him while he was abusing you? Allegedly."
Ms. Heard: "I gave it to him that year."
Ms. Vasquez: "Now, Ms. Heard, I'm going to need to talk to you about what happened in Australia in March of 2015. You've testified that at some point during the incident you described, you witnessed Mr. Depp bashing the phone against a wall, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You testified that the phone was breaking into pieces?"
Ms. Heard: "I was watching it disappear."
Ms. Vasquez: "And according to your testimony, this was a wall-mounted phone in the bar area?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's take a look at defendant's exhibit 1820. I believe this has already been admitted into evidence. If we could have it published. Thank you. You saw this photo during your direct examination, right?"
Ms. Vasquez: "You saw this photo during your direct examination, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you testified that the wall-mounted phone that you saw Mr. Depp smash is on the wall on the left?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "But it's not depicted in this photo, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Whoever took this photo was standing right in front of where that mounted phone was."
Ms. Vasquez: "That's convenient. The pieces of the phone Mr. Depp smashed aren't in this picture either, right?"
Ms. Heard: "You don't see it because it's...whoever took this photo is standing in front of that."
Ms. Vasquez: "Mr. King took this photo. Mr. King testified under oath in this trial, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And he testified that there was no wall-mounted phone smashed to smithereens that he had to replace, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "I didn't hear him testify to that. No."
Ms. Vasquez: "He did. The counsel listed it.  According to you, this is when Mr. Depp lost the tip of his finger, right? When he was smashing the phone?"
Ms. Heard: "It is my best guess. I didn't notice his finger come off. Obviously, I was watching him smash the phone and watching the pieces break while he was doing it."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. So you testified in this courtroom that after Mr. Depp smashed the phone, he held you down on the countertop by the neck. Do you remember that?"
Ms. Heard: "I'm not quite sure of the exact sequence of things, but yes, both of those things happened."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. We'll get to the sequence. And this is when Mr. Depp supposedly assaulted you with a bottle, right?"
Ms. Heard: "On the countertop, he assaulted me."
Ms. Vasquez: "So Mr. Depp was able to get you on the counter, right?"
Ms. Heard: "He held me down by my neck."
Ms. Vasquez: "And he grabbed a bottle according to you by holding you down by the neck, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "As I have always said, I don't remember exactly what happened first, or I don't remember the sequence, I just remember being aware that I was being assaulted by a bottle while I was on the countertop."
Ms. Vasquez: "So he penetrates you with this bottle? But you don't know how he got the bottle, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. And he did that right after he lost the tip of his right middle finger? We'll get to the sequence. And while he was on 8 to 10 MDMA pills, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Again, I don't remember the exact sequence of those events."
Ms. Vasquez: "We'll get to the sequence. And while he was on 8 to 10 MDMA pills, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's talk about the sequence. This is the sequence of events you testified to in this courtroom, that he smashed the phone to smithereens and then assaulted you, lost a tip of his finger, and then assaulted you with a bottle. Yes? That's the sequence of events that you testified to in this courtroom."
Ms. Heard: "To be clear, you're putting it in order when you say words like then. I have never claimed that I can remember the exact sequence of these things. This was a multi-day assault that took place over three horrible days.  It was the worst thing that ever happened to me."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. Let's focus on the testimony that you gave about the injuries. Mr. Depp, as you testified yesterday, wears rings on every finger, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Sometimes. I mean, often. And certainly, in the later part of our relationship, that was more normal than not, but if he's filming or something like that, of course, he's not gonna have his own jewelry on."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. And he was wearing rings on every finger in Australia, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "Not all the time. Not literally every single ring every single day. But he often wore his rings."
Ms. Vasquez: "Not often, Ms. Heard. Your words are, 'I've never known Johnny not to wear rings on every finger.'"
Ms. Heard: "That is what I testified to."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. And you testified that you bled as a result of this sexual assault? That your forearms were cut, along with your feet, and that you had a bruise across your jaw?"
Ms. Heard: "Correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And there is not a single medical record reflecting treatment for any of those injuries. Is there, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I did not seek treatment for my injuries."
Ms. Vasquez: "And when you were in Australia, Ms. Heard, you didn't take any pictures of the injuries you claimed to have sustained. Right?"
Ms. Heard: "I did not take any pictures. No"
Ms. Vasquez: "But you did take two pictures of the bathroom mirrors. Let's please pull up defendant's exhibit 374, which is already in evidence."
Ms. Vasquez: "You took this picture, right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes. That’s correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And this black paint on the mirror is from Mr. Depp?"
Ms. Heard: "That’s correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "He wrote on the mirror in black paint after his finger was cut off, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes. I only know that because there was blood as well as paint."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you took this picture after you had allegedly been assaulted by Mr. Depp? Yes?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "Yet you didn't capture yourself in the mirror, did you? Is that because you didn't have any visible injuries on you?"
Ms. Heard: "It's because I was taking a picture of the writing"
Ms. Vasquez: "Let's talk about the writing on this mirror. So the writing in black paint is for Mr. Depp, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "It's all from Mr. Depp."
Ms. Vasquez: "And it's your testimony under oath that you did not write the red text that says 'call Carly Simon, she said it better, babe?'"
Ms. Heard: "That’s correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "Because if you did write that, it means that your husband was walking around the house bleeding from his amputated finger and you're writing snarky messages to him on a mirror. Right?"
Ms. Heard: "I don't know what your question to me is. I'm sorry."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. So you would agree, Ms. Heard, that the black text on the mirror says 'she loves naked photos of herself, so modern, so hot'?"
Ms. Heard: "I had not read that yet. I mean, before. But yeah, that's what it says."
Ms. Vasquez: "(Internal Thoughts). But she took a picture of it, how could she not know what it said?  you were taking pictures of the text, but you had not read that before? or Leave it"
Mr. Chew: "Press her on this Ms. Vasquez!"
Ms. Vasquez: "But you were taking pictures of the text, but you had not read that before?"
Ms. Heard: "It didn't make sense to me at the time when I read it in person."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. Again, Mr. Depp wrote that?"
Ms. Heard: "I don't know who else would've."
Ms. Vasquez: "So, Ms. Heard, just to be clear, it's your testimony that Mr. Depp also wrote the message in red about Carly Simon saying it better, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That's correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You know Carly Simon singing the song, 'You're So Vain,' right?"
Ms. Heard: "I was told that."
Ms. Vasquez: "So it's your testimony that Mr. Depp was writing messages to himself in the mirror back and forth?"
Ms. Heard: "The best I can describe it is it looked like a crazy conversation. It was on the walls, it was on lampshades..."
Ms. Vasquez: "It's your testimony the crazy conversation was with himself?"
Ms. Heard: "That's what it looked like."
Ms. Vasquez: "And you would agree with me that in this photograph, the red text has been smudged with black paint, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That's what it looked like."
Ms. Vasquez: "So Mr. Depp must have not liked his own message to himself?"
Ms. Heard: "I’m not sure."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. Let's please pull up plaintiff's exhibit 343, which is already in evidence, and play the portion from 157:21 through 158:54. It's a recording, Your Honor."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "It's not to get you mad. It's not to get...it's just to get out of a bad situation while it's happening before it gets worse. In Australia, when we had the big fight where I lost the tip of my finger, at least five bathrooms and two bedrooms I went to..."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "To avoid talking to me?"
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "To escape. To escape the fight"
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "You don't escape the fight, you escape the solution. You escape the solution."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "You escape figuring it out. We cannot work it out if you run away to the bathroom every time."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "Listen to me. Listen to me. A boxer can't go 12 rounds without a fucking minute break."
Ms. Heard [Audio Tape]: "I'm not giving you a minute break, you do it at minute three at the beginning of an argument"
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "No. There are rounds, man. And when it gets too fucking hairy, the ref splits 'em apart or whatever. But all I'm saying is, you can't have a solution if the argument just keeps mounting, and mounting, and mounting, and mounting."
Mr. Depp [Audio Tape]: "I fucking go into the bathroom and sit on the floor, bam, bam, bam, here you come. I come out, fight, fight, fight, crazy, escalated. I split again, I go to another fucking bathroom or a bedroom or something. Knock, knock, knock, bang, bang, bang. You kept coming to get me."
Ms. Vasquez: "This is what really happened in Australia, isn't it, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I did knock on a bathroom door on the first night."
Ms. Vasquez: "Not a bathroom door, five bathroom doors, and two bedrooms. Isn't that right?"
Ms. Heard: "Johnny is not an accurate historian of what happened during that..."
Ms. Vasquez: "Ms. Heard, that's not my question. Five bathroom doors, two bedrooms. That's what you knocked on. That's what actually happened in Australia. Isn't it, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I remember it. I knocked on one bathroom door. I came on the first night after he decided to take the bag of MDMA and I went."
Ms. Vasquez: "The recording we just listened to, that's exactly what happened in Australia. Mr. Depp lost the tip of his finger after you threw a bottle at him. Isn't that right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is incorrect."
Ms. Vasquez: "Okay. You're the one who assaulted someone with a bottle in Australia. Isn't that right, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I didn't assault Johnny in Australia. I didn't assault Johnny ever. I couldn't."
Ms. Vasquez: "And then after he was injured, he had to hide from you, right?  In five bathrooms, two bedrooms. And you would pursue him. Because he was avoiding talking to you. Right? You weren't scared of him at all, were you?"
Ms. Heard: "I have a mixed relationship with Johnny, one in which I'm scared and one in which I love him very much"
Ms. Vasquez: "I'm not talking about your mixed relationship. That night in Australia after you cut off his finger with a bottle, you weren't scared of him at all, were you?"
Ms. Heard: "This is a man who tried to kill me. Of course, it's scary. He's also my husband."
Ms. Vasquez: "March 8th is the day that you were allegedly sexually assaulted by Mr. Depp in Australia, correct?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "And Mr. Depp's finger had just been cut off, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You sent a text message to your therapist that night, 'I feel so lost. I can't talk. I don't know if I'll ever be able to change.' Did I read that correctly?"
Ms. Heard: "That is correct."
Ms. Vasquez: "You weren't able to change, were you, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I very much wanted to leave the relationship I was in, but I didn't have the power. I didn't feel I had the power to leave. I knew I was in a very toxic relationship with Johnny, and I knew I needed to change that. I knew it was, at this point, horrible for me. And I talked to my therapist often about that."

# May 19, 2022, Continued.

Ms. Vasquez: "If we could please pull up plaintiff's exhibit 1280, which is a clip from your divorce deposition."
Woman: "Ms. Heard, did you send a text message to Jerry Judge on May 24th, 2016, telling Jerry Judge 'I'm desperately trying to reach Johnny. It's extremely important. Please tell him?'"
Ms. Heard: "I remember sending the text message that is in front of me right now to Jerry. And I would like...I remember sending this because I wanted to tell Johnny or have him told by Jerry or someone who knew him or was close to him. Basically, I didn't want him to find out online that I had or was about to file, or I had already filed for divorce."
Ms. Heard: "I wanted him to know verbally. So I was trying to reach him through a third party to tell him. When I say reach, I'm specifically saying I would like him to know information coming from me or coming from Jerry from me so that he finds out about the divorce filing or my intention to do so from some other source other than TMZ, which was alerted."
Ms. Heard: "…"
Ms. Vasquez: "You slipped up there, didn't you, Ms. Heard? You let it slip out that TMZ had been alerted to your filing of the domestic violence restraining order, didn't you?"
Ms. Heard: "I disagree. That's not what I'm talking about."
Ms. Vasquez: "TMZ is the same outlet that you released the video of Mr. Depp attacking the kitchen cabinets the day before this deposition was taken, wasn't it?"
Ms. Heard: "I didn't do that. I don't know how to do that."
Ms. Vasquez: "TMZ owns the copyright to that video now, doesn't it?"
Ms. Heard: "I have no idea what TMZ owns"
Ms. Vasquez: "Did they pay you for that?"
Ms. Heard: "I never got paid for it because I had nothing to do with that."
Ms. Vasquez: "So TMZ was just lucky in getting the inside scoop to your divorce from Mr. Depp, huh?"
Ms. Heard: "I have no idea. It is not...that's not my area of expertise. I wouldn't even know how to do that. And also, what does that get me? If I wanted to leak things about Johnny, I could have done that in a much more successful way, in a bigger way. For years."
Ms. Vasquez: "Not when you were extorting him for $7 million."
Ms. Vasquez: "Tasya van Ree is your ex-wife, right?"
Ms. Heard: "That's right. She's my ex-partner."
Ms. Vasquez: "She's the one that you told this jury Mr. Depp was jealous of, right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yeah. Well, that was a 2013 fight, around March. Yes."
Ms. Vasquez: "You committed domestic violence against Ms. van Ree during your relationship, didn't you?"
Ms. Heard: "No, I did not."
Ms. Vasquez: "You assaulted her at a Seattle airport in 2009, didn't you?"
Ms. Heard: "No, I did not."
Ms. Vasquez: "And people saw that."
Ms. Heard: "That's not true."
Ms. Vasquez: "And it was covered in the press. Isn't that true?"
Ms. Heard: "It was planted in the press by Johnny's team two days after I got the TRO. Not coincidentally."
Ms. Vasquez: "Can you please pull up plaintiff's exhibit 1279?"
Ms. Vasquez: "If we could please have that article displayed for the witness? This is an article from two years ago, correct, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I don't know when this article was published."
Ms. Vasquez: "May of 2020. The title reads, 'Amber Heard allegedly grabbed, struck her ex-girlfriend at the airport,' doesn't it?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes. And that's not true."
Ms. Vasquez: "'Amber Heard allegedly struck her ex-girlfriend, Tasya van Ree, at the airport in 2009.' Did I read that right?"
Ms. Heard: "Yes. This is another example of the smear campaign"
Ms. Vasquez: "So Mr. Depp is not the only domestic partner you've assaulted, is he, Ms. Heard?"
Ms. Heard: "I've never assaulted Mr. Depp or anyone else that I've been romantically linked to ever."
Ms. Vasquez: "No further questions, Your Honor."
Judge Azcarate: "Alright, this is a good place to stop. Thank you everyone, and stay safe out there."
